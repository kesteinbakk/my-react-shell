# T018 — complete-component-surface

**Filed 2026-06-23 · Status: in-progress**

Re-found my-react-shell as a **complete, opinionated support and starting base for
React projects** — the React counterpart to what the SolidJS `foundation` is for
Solid — and **drop shadcn entirely**, shipping the whole component surface ourselves
on Radix + the theme tokens so a new project starts fast from one front door.

## Progress (2026-06-23)

- **W1 — done.** strategy.md deleted; concept.md rewritten; this task filed.
- **W2 — done.** All live docs swept; zero dangling strategy.md/Dx/shadcn-direction refs.
- **W4 — done.** Canonical `Tone` + `TONE_COLOR`; Alert/ConfirmDialog/ActionButton
  `variant`→`tone`; Badge gained `primary`; StatCard/PhiCard on the shared `Tone`.
- **W3 — done.** No-new-dep: `Button`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Label`, `Card`(+subparts),
  `Separator`, `Skeleton`, `Dialog`, `Popover`, `DropdownMenu`. Dependency-approved +
  built: `Checkbox`, `Switch`, `RadioGroup`, `Tooltip`, `Tabs` (5 new optional `@radix-ui`
  peers). The complete primitive surface now ships.
- **Landed on main.** Reconciled with concurrent T019 (CountPill) + a docs commit;
  adopted main's renamed token vocabulary (`-strong`→`-on-bg`, `-content`→`-on`);
  fast-forwarded `main`. Lib typecheck clean; the 5 new peers installed.
- **W5 (demo) — done.** Migrated to the tone API (16 edits) and showcased all 15 new
  primitives across the kit pages (icons registered in `shell-config`; the 5 Radix peers
  added to the demo). Demo typecheck green; committed.
- **W6 (evaluering) — migrated green.** tone API fixed (3 edits); typechecks against the
  new shell; committed. The full **drop-shadcn** consolidation (~80 files; the shadcn
  `Button` `variant`-decomposition drives ~90 call sites) is spun off as its own task,
  run locally in evaluering.
- **react-framework skill — deferred** until a shell tag ships the new exports to new
  projects.

## Why

Agents building on the library (evaluering) get confused at the boundary between two
component sources. The reported symptom: two `Badge`s with the same name and different
APIs —

- **Shell `Badge`** (`my-react-shell/components`) — `tone`-based: `<Badge tone="success" dot>`.
- **shadcn `Badge`** (`@/components/ui/badge`) — `variant`-based: `<Badge variant="secondary">`.

That collision is one instance of a structural cost in the old "menu of modules,
primitives stay the consumer's" model: for every component an agent must decide *which
source*, and where both sources ship the same name the two APIs clash.

Two findings turned this from "document it better" into "change the model":

1. **shadcn was never a dependency of this library.** Every interactive kit component
   already builds **directly on `@radix-ui/*`** + `class-variance-authority` + `mrs-`
   CSS + the `--color-*` tokens. shadcn appears only in comments and as the
   *consumer's* copy-in source for un-opinionated primitives. shadcn *is* Radix + cva +
   Tailwind — exactly the idiom we already use. So "shadcn vs Radix" is a false choice;
   we are 100% Radix already.
2. **The "consumer owns the primitive source" value is one our consumers don't cash
   in.** shadcn's whole pitch is "you own and edit the component source." These
   consumers are largely agent-built apps under `~/Developer/`; they almost never
   hand-edit a Button's internals. They pay the collision + which-source cost for a
   benefit they don't use.

**User decision (2026-06-23):** go opinionated and complete. *"I do not want 'the
consumer owns their primitive source'. I want us here to pick and prepare, so building
new projects goes fast. Do we really need shadcn?"* — No. Ship everything ourselves.

---

## The decision

- **Thesis:** my-react-shell is a **support + starting base for React projects**, the
  way `foundation` is for Solid. Opinionated, batteries-included, modular.
- **Drop shadcn.** Consumers add no shadcn, keep no `components/ui/`, run no
  `npx shadcn add`, maintain no `components.json`.
- **Ship the full component surface** from `my-react-shell/components`: the existing
  opinionated composites **plus** the un-opinionated primitives, all in the same Radix +
  `--color-*` + `mrs-` idiom.
- **Unify the prop convention:** `tone` = semantic color; `variant` = structural style.
- **Re-found the docs:** delete `strategy.md` (the `Dx` decision/rule log) and rewrite
  `concept.md` to the new thesis; purge every dangling reference.

### What dropping shadcn buys

1. **No cssVar bridge.** Today consumers hand-roll CSS mapping shadcn's `--background`
   / `--muted-foreground` to our `--color-*` contract (the old strategy doc itself
   called this un-shippable per-app latitude and a drift source). Our primitives render
   against `--color-*` directly — the bridge disappears.
2. **No name collisions.** One `Badge`, one `Button`. The evaluering confusion is gone
   at the root.
3. **No "which source?" decision.** Everything imports from `my-react-shell/components`.
4. **One convention** across primitives and composites.
5. **Less consumer setup.** Tailwind becomes the consumer's choice for *their own*
   markup, not a prerequisite to render a button.

### The cost (accepted)

- We own ~12–15 more small, stable components.
- We lose `npx shadcn add <exotic>` for free; anything exotic we build on Radix
  ourselves (same idiom) and rule-of-two pulls it into the kit.

## Scope

### W1 — Doc re-founding *(done in the filing turn)*

- **Delete** `docs/strategy.md`.
- **Rewrite** `docs/concept.md` to the support/starting-base thesis.
- Create this task doc; reserve T018 in the index.

### W2 — Reference purge (live docs only)

Remove every dangling `strategy.md` / `Dx` / "use shadcn directly" / "consumer owns
primitives" reference and reconcile each doc to the new model:

- `CLAUDE.md` — the project charter block, the stack/auth/UI sections, the "How
  consumers use my-react-shell" snippet (drop the shadcn import line).
- `README.md`
- `docs/demo.md` — the `/components` route is no longer "consumer-owned shadcn
  primitives"; it becomes a kit-owned primitives showcase.
- `docs/guides/distribution-model.md` — `Dx` cites.
- `docs/guides/theme.md` — **delete the shadcn-bridge section** ("Using these tokens
  with shadcn/ui").
- `docs/specifications/api-reference.md` — drop "primitives are NOT shipped — use
  shadcn directly"; document the new primitives.

> Point-in-time records are **not** rewritten: the historical `docs/2-tasks/T0xx/task.md`
> files and `docs/4-reports/status/2026-06-17-away-report.md` keep their `Dx` references.

**Deferred to after W3 ships:** the `react-framework` skill
(`.claude/skills/react-framework/react-framework-notes.md`) still installs shadcn
(`shadcn init` / `shadcn add button dialog input …`) as the new-project UI layer.
Updating it to drop shadcn in favor of `my-react-shell/components` must wait until the
primitive set actually exists — doing it now would point new projects at exports that
aren't shipped yet.

### W3 — Build the primitive set

Ship the un-opinionated primitives in the kit idiom. Two implementation tiers:

- **Plain element + cva + `mrs-` CSS** (no new peer): `Button`, `Input`, `Textarea`,
  `Label`, `Card`, `Separator`, `Skeleton`.
- **Radix-wrapped** (new optional peers, approval-gated at install — same pattern as
  the existing Radix peers): `Checkbox`, `Switch`, `RadioGroup`, `Tooltip`, `Tabs`, a
  general `Dialog`. Plus **expose** the `DropdownMenu` and `Popover` we already wrap
  internally (PhiCard / ColorPicker) as first-class exports.

Each ships its `…Props` type, a `components.css` block, an `index.ts` export, an
api-reference row, and a demo section.

### W4 — `tone` / `variant` consistency cleanup (whole kit)

**Convention (locked):** `tone` = semantic color; `variant` = structural style/emphasis.

**Canonical `Tone`.** Introduce one shared semantic-color type for the whole kit,
promoted from today's `accent.ts` `AccentTone` (which already maps each value → a
`--color-*` token):

```ts
type Tone = 'primary' | 'neutral' | 'info' | 'success' | 'warning' | 'danger'
```

Components use the canonical `Tone` or a documented narrowing of it; the `--color-*`
mapping stays in one place. The new `Button` and the existing `ActionButton` use the
full `Tone`.

**Full audit (verified 2026-06-23 from source):**

| Component | Today | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `Badge` | `tone` — neutral/info/success/warning/danger | ✓ name correct → adopt canonical `Tone` (gains `primary`) |
| `StatCard` | `tone: AccentTone` | ✓ → `Tone` (AccentTone promoted to the shared type) |
| `PhiCard` | `tone: AccentTone` | ✓ → `Tone` |
| `Toast` | `tone: ToastTone = AlertVariant` | ✓ name correct; type follows Alert → `AlertTone` |
| `Alert` | **`variant`** — info/success/warning/danger | **rename → `tone`**; keeps its no-`neutral` set by design (InfoBox is the neutral sibling) |
| `ConfirmDialog` | **`variant: default/danger`** | **rename → `tone: 'neutral' \| 'danger'`** |
| `ActionButton` | **`variant`** — …/secondary/… (pure color) | **rename → `tone`**; drop the unused `secondary` to land on canonical `Tone`; `ActionPreset.variant` → `ActionPreset.tone` |
| `Collapsible` | `variant` — default/bordered/ghost/filled | ✓ structural — leave |
| `Accordion` | `variant` — default/bordered/separated | ✓ structural — leave |

**Follow-through, easy to miss:**
- `Toast` renders an `<Alert>` internally — its internal `variant=` → `tone=`.
- Rename every `…Variant` type that's actually a *color* to `…Tone` (`AlertVariant` →
  `AlertTone`, `ActionButtonVariant` → `ActionButtonTone`, `ToastTone` re-points to
  `AlertTone`); the genuinely structural ones keep `…Variant` (`AccordionVariant`,
  `CollapsibleVariant`). CSS class names (`mrs-*--success` etc.) are unaffected.

**Two judgment calls (decided, reversible):** Badge gains `primary` (harmless superset,
buys consistency); ActionButton drops `secondary` (no preset uses it; not in canonical
`Tone`).

All breaking — no compat shims (see Decisions). Each rename updates the component, its
type exports, the api-reference rows, and the demo kit pages, then rebuilds `dist/`.

### W5 — Demo (`my-react-shell-demo`)

- The `/components` route stops being "consumer-owned shadcn primitives" and becomes a
  **kit primitives** showcase (Button/Input/Checkbox/…), imported from
  `my-react-shell/components`.
- New/changed components reach their kit pages (`InputsActionsPage`, etc.) with their
  scroll-spy `icon` keys registered in both `ICONS` and `EMOJIS` (`shell-config.tsx`).

### W6 — Consumer migration (`evaluering`) — separate consumer task

- Remove `components/ui/` (shadcn) and `components.json`.
- Repoint imports to `my-react-shell/components`.
- Delete the hand-rolled shadcn cssVar bridge.
- Migrate the `tone`-rename breakages (`Alert`, `ConfirmDialog`, `ActionButton`).
- File as an evaluering-side task; it depends on this shipping + a tag bump.

## Decisions (locked 2026-06-23)

1. **Rollout breadth → complete set in one pass.** Ship the whole primitive surface now.
2. **`Button` API → our convention, never shadcn's.** Mirroring shadcn's `variant`
   grab-bag would re-import the exact problem this task removes. The API is two
   orthogonal axes + size:
   - `variant` (structural fill/emphasis): `solid · soft · outline · ghost · link` — default `solid`
   - `tone` (semantic color): `primary · neutral · info · success · warning · danger` — default `primary`
   - `size`: `sm · md · lg` — default `md`

   So: primary `<Button>Save</Button>` · secondary `<Button variant="outline">Cancel</Button>`
   · destructive `<Button tone="danger">Delete</Button>` · quiet `<Button variant="ghost">`.
3. **`ActionButton` → clean `variant`→`tone` rename** (pure-color axis; see W4).
4. **Breaking renames accepted — no compat shims.** Migration cost is not a factor: the
   single consumer (a small project) drops shadcn and refactors regardless. Clean break.

---

## Ground truth (verified 2026-06-23)

- Radix imports across the kit: `Accordion`, `Collapsible`, `ConfirmDialog`,
  `UserPreferences` (Dialog), `Select`, `ColorPicker` (Popover), `PhiCard`
  (DropdownMenu). No `components/ui/` import anywhere; "shadcn" only in comments.
- `package.json`: Radix packages are **optional peers** already; no shadcn dependency.
- Semantic-color prop split today: `tone` in `Badge`/`StatCard`/`Toast`; `variant` in
  `Alert`/`ActionButton`/`ConfirmDialog`. Color **values** are already uniform
  (`danger`/`success`/`warning`/`info`); only the prop *name* splits.

  complete, opinionated base.
